Glass top for the Ploopy Co Trackpad.  

These parts are based on the Knob hardware made by Ploopy Corporation. Full source can be found on their GitHub: https://github.com/ploopyco/trackpad


Please note that the sunkTop is not tested. If you do test it, please report back with results!

The sunkTop is meant to place the glass level to the bezel. It may be diffigult to print, as the original prints with the top against the print bed. It may be possible to print the bezel, add the glass and then print on the glass as support, this is not tested.
